CCHA05 - Adaptive User Interfaces for Multilingual Academic Search

Searching for academic information is challenging as academic documents are written in domain specific languages and tend to be very long. Users who speak multiple languages may benefit from language support that includes information in the languages of their preference.

In this project, you will build a multilingual search system with interfaces that dynamically change in terms of layouts and features, depending on the user’s language background, language assistance history, language preference and language competency profile.

The project will be divided into two parts. One student will build a user model that considers language background and competency. The second student will work on language support interface features that adjust based on user language competency.
